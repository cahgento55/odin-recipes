            <h3>First of all, century egg or thousand-year old eggs 皮蛋 as they are sometimes called are not one hundred years old. They are simply eggs that have been treated in a basic solution that dramatically transforms them into a striking accompaniment to jok or savory rice gruel.</h3>

            <h3>My first attempt at homemade century eggs was an epic failure, so victory this round was especially sweet</h3>

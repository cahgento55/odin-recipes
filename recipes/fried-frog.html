        <h3><em> what do frog legs taste like?</em> Frog is often said to taste like chicken, because it is mild in flavor. Frog legs can be best compared to chicken wings in taste and texture, but some people say that they taste similar to fish.</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Legend has it that the French started eating frogs' legs in the 12th century when cunning monks who were forced into a “no-meat” diet managed to have frogs classified as fish. The peasants soon started to eat them too. The delicacy is particularly popular in eastern France, especially in the Vosges department.</h3>
